15. This grace Gnd uwcs tu no une. For what nau he
owo to him, who is imo to give nothing first, that ho may
ho recompensas? (Boia ai. 35⁴) Nay, πωπω] ho owe
to him, who has nothing of his own but siu aud a lie?
ΠΕ, theros-iia7 who receives this giaco, owos and raudera
ovorlasting thinks to aod ; he who receives it not, either
does hot aare fur those spiritual things, and rests satisfiod
within himsa1f; or, being secure, ho vainly glorios that
he possessos what ho hos uoti Moroovar, oonoorning
those who oatwardly process saith ahoi amend their nvos,
it is best to judga aod speak astar tho example of tho
apastles 5 foi tha iaioost rooossos (penetralia) of tha haart
are to us impenetmble. Aa for those who have not yot
hoen tanati, it bchoves us ω pray to God, who calls tha
things which aro hot, aa though thoy wem hat in ho
wiso ara wa to aot prouilly against thom (adversus sopor-
hiandum sos aaa), as if wo had modo ouraaives to differ.
(Rom. xi,18—2ot 1 eorv iv. 6, 7,)
