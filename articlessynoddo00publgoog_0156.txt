souable to think of a provincial Synod7 fol· the composing
ef these cunarum-sies. Remum, iu like manner, as it bz-
hoved partieular Synods in eaela of the provinces, to pre-
cede the national Synod, so in Hollaznl also, both North
and Sonth (Holland)‚ particular Synods would preoede.
Yet the Remonstrants, hy their favonrers, pressed eagerly
end urged such a Syned: either because they thought
that it would less obstruet their oausef ns they had in Hol-
land so rnany great nien and even paswrsfavouring thern ς
or thnt they might hy this tergiversatiou absolutely hinder
the calling of the sational svnod⁴ But when they thom<
selves saw that this demand was too unjnst for thern
easily to persuade (the granting of> lt, they ded to a now
exception, and desired (or proposed) that this cause should
he deferred (or reserved) to a general eonneil (manmena
cem). But it was answered thern, that it was most nn-
certuin whether or when a general cutinei] could be called 5
yet that these evils required a present remedy, and that
this sational (Synod) about to be called hy the States
General would be, as it were, an oeeumenical aud general
(eonn0i1); when depnties horn almost all the Reformed
ehurches would be present ab the salue⁴ If they should
toeonnt themselves eggrieved hy the judgrnent of sneh a
Synod, it would always be entire aud lawful w them to
eppeal froin this national to a general eonnefl; provided
only, that in the meantime they oheyed the judgnient of
tho mationa] Synod. By these ovasions and subterfuges
they effected that the letters of couvoeatiou wel-e for sume
little time delayed ; and lt was necessary that the day ap.
pninbed for the meeting should be changed and defcrred.*
