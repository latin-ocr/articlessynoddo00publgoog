verting ou them as σαι-καταθεῖσα, if they refused to appear

criminal, unscriptumL unressounble, or not, is by no
means the present question, but how far the Synna of
Dort went beyond the precedente of former times, end
of other cossun-ies.

auximan impartinl mind not diffieu1t3 but how tar the
whole of this procedure, either in this Synna, or in other
similas cases on tha continent and in our land, was wrong,
in ιοιο or inpane, whether the whole must be reprobatae}
